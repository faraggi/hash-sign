## short description

hash sign is the modern (and covid-compatible) version of signing autographs for celebrities

## long description

are you a celebrity? didn't think so... but if you were, you just need to tweet your eth addr, and can start signing autographs and sending them to your fans world-wide, all without getting out of your jacuzzi
just open the hashsign app and scribble your john hancock

do you have a fav celeb? send him a autograph request and see if and when he replies

so long as we're at it... lets get celebrities to compete on who cares most about their fans with a celeb high score table

and let them choose the signature background to whatever they want?
leo messi? stadium maybe
babe ruth? baseball
snoop dog? some photo of his weed


anyway...celebs get to sign autographs during covid, and we get to sell our celebritty's handwritten 'mouche' on ethereum in 10 years for millions 



##  How It's Made 
- simple mobile app to capture drawings, built with react or some other multiplatform framework
- app should also showcase a high score table for ranking celebs + account creation and validation (twitter SSO)
- no need for backend
- unique NFt wil be created for each autograph, and HAS to be sent to some other addy (fans addy)
- NFTs will track the signatures hashed from the picture they draw on the mobile app. (dev question: should we map the pixels to some table on chain?)
